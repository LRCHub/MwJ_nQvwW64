Yeah, between the doors
Shakin' heads and thinking light about
Who you're with and where you are
Blue lightning hittin' trees and lighting roads
Won't let me get too down

'Cause sometimes you can be let down

You move on ahead in quicksand
You hope you're still goin' east boy
It's dreamy all day drives and short parades
And I won't let it mess with my head
Just grin and live it while you can
With wonderment

With eyes wide open
I'm taking in all I can
Small town darkness
Is singing by in trance
I'm feeling glad

You and your friends drink, laugh and pass out
Keeping good things close
Fought till the end, it's hard to keep it all fun
But I won't let it mess with my head
Won't let it mess with sleeping friends
Or their wonderment

With eyes wide open
I'm taking in all I can
Small town darkness
Is singing by in trance
I'm feeling wierd

Though the day's been really long
I still feel I'm close to nowhere
I wouldn't let no one take my place, oh, no one
Oh yeah, a warm bed in my head
I can see the tidal wave of disappointment
See the lights shining over there
Through the night I am on the way
On the way
On the way
On the way
On the way

With eyes wide open
I'm taking in all I can
Small town darkness
Is singing by in trance
I'm
With eyes wide open
I'm taking in all I can
Small town darkness
Is singing by in trance
I'm feeling glad
