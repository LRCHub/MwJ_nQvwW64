The gettin's in the going
Said the river to the ocean
On their winding way to where they meet
This feelin' we keep holding on
Should be lettin' go and let the
Current sweep us off our feet
Show us where we're supposed to be

There ain't no shortcut to Waco
Whichever way that we go
We ain't gonna make it on time
We oughta inch a little closer
Ease on over to the shoulder
Make some lost highway, roadside,
Star aligning, heart pounding lovin' tonight

Speeding up won't get us nowhere
Slowing down won't mean we quit
Inside the present is the gift
And it's the only one we get

There ain't no shortcut to Waco
Whichever way that we go
We ain't gonna make it on time
We oughta inch a little closer
Ease on over to the shoulder
Make some lost highway, roadside,
Star aligning, heart pounding lovin' tonight
You say tomato
I say tomato
Baby it's all the same
You scream I scream
We all scream sometimes
To keep from going insane

There ain't no shortcut to Waco
Whichever way that we go
We ain't gonna make it on time
We oughta inch a little closer
Ease on over to the shoulder
Make some lost highway, roadside,
Star aligning, heart pounding lovin' tonight
The gettin's in the going
Said the river to the ocean
On their winding way to where they meet
