Been a long day,
been a long year
Running in circles
Jumping the hurdles
'Til you walked in my life
Everything changed and I swear
I couldn't have planned it
You were the answer
I never thought I would find
They say love can come so soon
You're my living proof
Oh my God, what a blessing
Outta 10, you're 11
I waited so long,
I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallelujah
I waited so long,
I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
I think I struck gold
and I found home
All at the same time
My high and my baseline
You're my holiest ground
So good it hurts,
you make it worth
All of the waiting
Somebody patient
Somebody kind
They say love can come so soon
You're my living proof
Oh my God, what a blessing
Outta 10, you're 11
I waited so long,
I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallelujah
I waited so long,
I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
They say love can come so soon
Thank God that I found you
Oh my God, what a blessing
Outta 10, you're 11
I waited so long,
I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
Never the same since I knew ya
One touch and I say Hallelujah
I waited so long,
I'll never move on
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
(Now that I found ya)
(Now that I found ya)
(Now that I found ya)
Your love is a shortcut
to heaven
